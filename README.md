# ExplainXKCD importer

A small ruby script to pull together information for building explainxkcd wiki pages.

Pulls together:
+ image name
+ title
+ number
+ title text
+ transcript
+ explanation (if it exists)

With great power comes great responsibility. You, as the user of the script MUST
promise me, and the script (at each runtime) that you are not simply pulling
this information together and plopping it into the textbox. I want this to be a
tool to get the tedious and machine repeatable stuff out of the way. Human's
are needed to parse through and see what needs to have Wikipedia links, external
links, etc.

If I find you not using this script correctly, I will find you and maim your
keyboard so you can no longer do the foul things you do.
